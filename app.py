# FILE: app.py
# PURPOSE: Main application file for the AI Email Generator.
# ==============================================================================

# 1. IMPORT LIBRARIES
# -------------------
# We import Streamlit for the web UI, Google Generative AI for the AI model,
# and OS for interacting with environment variables (our API key).
import streamlit as st
import google.generativeai as genai
import os

# 2. CONFIGURE THE PAGE AND API KEY
# ---------------------------------
# Set the title and icon that appear in the browser tab.
st.set_page_config(
    page_title="Gemini Email Generator",
    page_icon="ðŸ“§",
    layout="centered"
)

# This is the most important part for deployment.
# We try to get the API key from Streamlit's secret management.
# This is secure and the recommended way for deployed apps.
try:
    # This line will work when you deploy on Streamlit Community Cloud
    api_key = st.secrets["GOOGLE_API_KEY"]
    genai.configure(api_key=api_key)
except KeyError:
    # This part is for local development if you want to run it on your own computer.
    # It tells you that you need to set up your secrets for deployment.
    st.error("API Key not found. Please add your GOOGLE_API_KEY to the Streamlit secrets.")
    st.stop() # Stop the app if the key is not found.


# 3. DEFINE THE AI FUNCTION
# -------------------------
# This function will take user input and send it to the Gemini API.
def generate_email(recipient, sender, purpose, tone, key_points):
    """
    Uses the Gemini API to generate an email based on provided details.

    model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash')

    # A good prompt gives much better results.

    You are a professional email writing assistant. Your task is to generate a high-quality email.

    **Email Details:**
    - **To:** {recipient}
    - **From:** {sender}
    - **Tone:** {tone}
    - **Purpose:** {purpose}
    - **Key Points to Include:**
    {key_points}

    **Instructions:**
    1. Generate a relevant and concise subject line. Do not use a placeholder like "[Subject]".
    2. Write the email body, making sure it flows well and incorporates all key points.
    3. The email should start with a proper greeting and end with an appropriate closing.
    4. The final output must be ONLY the email (Subject, Body, Closing). Do not add any extra notes.
